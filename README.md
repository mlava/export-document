This extension allows you to export a page in your graph into either .docx or .pdf format.

There are three configuration settings allowing you to:

- Exclude blocks with tag
  - define a tag that will mean any block containing this tag will not be included in the export (leave blank to exclude no blocks)
- Flatten page hierarchy
  - export all content justified to the left, with no indentation (leave off to keep indentation intact)
- Include Linked References
  - include the linked references section in the page export (leave off to exclude)
